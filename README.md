Proud to share my latest mini project — a fully functional student registration form that dynamically displays submitted entries in a styled table 📝✅

✅ Built using:

🎨 Tailwind CSS for modern UI

⚙ JavaScript for form handling, validation, and dynamic table rendering

💣 Added row deletion + auto-hide table when all entries are deleted

📌 Features:

Clean responsive UI

Form validation with alert prompts

Dynamic table creation on submit

Delete individual entries

Hide table when all rows are deleted

📂 Tech Stack: HTML, CSS (Tailwind), JavaScript
🚀 Next Step: Diving into React.js for more interactive web apps! 🔥

🧠 Practicing projects like these is the best way to master JS before jumping into frameworks!
